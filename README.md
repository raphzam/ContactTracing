#Contact Tracing

Currently working on a refactor with better OOP Design here: https://github.com/raphzam/contact-trace/

This program prompts an incoming patient for their contact information, symptoms, and people they have come in contact with.

#VersionHistory

    PatientAppV3 (beta)
    patient symptoms are now logged with an enhanced for loop
    added iterable symptom database so new symptoms could be added

    PatientAppV2
    fixed bug where user is prompted for contacted persons despite saying no contact history
    modified to ask user about each symptom
    modified to add multiple patients to one report
    


    PatientApp
    original submission
    showed menu of symptoms prompting user to add until done
